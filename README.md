## What's a CatPack?

A CatPack is an image or set of images that is used with Prism Launcher. This aesthetically changes the launcher by changing the background on the main screen in the list of instances.

There are 2 types of CatPacks:

- Simple CatPacks - these are literally just 1 image.
- Advanced CatPacks - these are folders with a JSON file and a bunch of images inside. The JSON dictates how the CatPack is intended to work.

For more information on CatPacks, refer to the [Prism Launcher wiki](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/catpacks/).

Documentation surrounding the project is currently work-in-progress. Check back later.
