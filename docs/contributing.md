# Contributing

Want to help? Great! To get started, follow these steps. This guide assumes you know how to use Git on a basic level.

- [Fork this repository](https://github.com/KTrain5169/CatPackMaker/fork) and clone your fork.
- Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`, then run `venv\scripts\activate` to activate it.
- Install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Make your changes, then test your changes to see if they will work.
- Commit your changes and push it, then create a Pull Request.
- Your PR will be reviewed and will either have changes requested or approved and merged.

We recommend the following when contributing:

- Using VS Code (or a fork of it)? You should see recommendations regarding extensions to use. We recommend installing them.
- We also recommend installing `autopep8` via `pip install autopep8` to ensure you follow styling.
- Before committing your changes and pushing them it may be a good idea to build and then test them. This isn't strictly necessary, but can be helpful.
- Be helpful in your commit names.
